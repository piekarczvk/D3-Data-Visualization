## Step 1 - Fork and clone the repository

Click **Fork** to make a copy of this repository under your name space.

Then, you should clone onto your machine.

If you're using VS Code as recommended, click on **Code** and select **Visual Studio Code (SSH)**.

If that doesn't work, click on **Code** and copy the address under **Clone with SSH**. On your machine, you can then open a terminal, go to your code directory and type `git clone <address copied>`.

Throughout this lab, make sure to regularly commit and push your changes, so that you don't lose your work!

## Step 2 - Complete the lab exercises

Note that the code provided will throw errors! That's normal, you have to complete it to make things work.

The lab is separated in different parts.

### Part 1 - Write code for an inline bar chart

In [main.js](scripts/main.js), modify the code under the `PART 1` comment using the instruction from the lab sheet. You will also need to modify [main.css](styles/main.css).

### Part 2 - Use the bar chart class

In [main.js](scripts/main.js), modify the code under the `PART 2` comment using the instruction from the lab sheet.

### Part 3 - Add scales to the bar chart class

In [BarChart.js](scripts/BarChart.js), modify the code where the `PART 3` comments appear using the instruction from the lab sheet.

### Part 4 - Add axes to the bar chart class

In [BarChart.js](scripts/BarChart.js), modify the code where the `PART 4` comments appear using the instruction from the lab sheet.

### Part 5 - Use shape generators

In [DonutChart.js](scripts/DonutChart.js) and [LineChart.js](scripts/LineChart.js), complete the classes using the sample code from the lab sheet (and the class structure introduced by [BarChart.js](scripts/BarChart.js)). You will also need to modify [main.css](styles/main.css).

### Extra

The lab sheet also mentions a [Bubble Chart](scripts/BubbleChart.js) and a [Scatter Plot](scripts/ScatterPlot.js). Complete these files with what you have learned.
